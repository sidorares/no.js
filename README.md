Eventually here might be a distribution of node/iojs where parts of core replaced with libraries available in npm

shage 1: collect links to what is available right now:

- no.js core core: (smaller) module system, basic fs, basic timers, basic tcp/udp/pipes, child process, vm
- probably binary addons, but host on npm: http (or just http-parser), zlib, crypto, pty, os
- js-only, host on npm: http (high level logic, agents etc), dns, utils, console, punycode, debugger library and cli, readline, repl, url, path, query-string, streams
